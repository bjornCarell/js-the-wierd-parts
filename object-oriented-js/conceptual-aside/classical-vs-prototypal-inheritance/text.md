#clasical vs prototyap inheritance

What to we mean? 

Classical
The way it has been done for a long time. Like in 
languages like Java and C#

It is very verbose. Can be hard to understand what does
what and what will impact what.

It is not bad. It works. That's why it's so popular. 


Prototypal
    Simple.
        flexible
        extensible
        easy to understand 

And in JS what we need to understand is that inharitance means: 
One object gets access to the properties and methods of another object.
