'use strict'

must be written at the top of the file, or
at the top of a function

'use strict' must be at the top of an execution context.

strict mode can help us under some circiumstances. But remember, JS is a 
very flexible languange, with flexibillity comes lack of rules. Even
if we use 'use strict'.

Different JS engines have different 'use strict' rules.
