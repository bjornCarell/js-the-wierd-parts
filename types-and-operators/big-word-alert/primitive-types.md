# Primitive type
## A type of datat that represens a single value

That is, not an object. 

## undefined 
represents lack of existence (you should not set a variable to undefined)

## null
null represents lack of existence. 
Special case: try console.log(typeof null),
you will see that the output tells a confusing story. 

## boolean 
true or false

## numbers 
Only one numeric type: Floating type. While we can fake it, to get
the effect of other numeric types. This can make math in JS a 
bit wierd.
