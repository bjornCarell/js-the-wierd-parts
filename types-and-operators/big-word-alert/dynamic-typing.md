# Dynamic typing

You don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds,
it figures it out while your code is running.

Variables can hold different types of values because it's all
figured out during execution. 

It figures things out on the fly.

Other languages, like JAVA, uses static typing, it tells the 
engine before the variable is declared, what type to expect.

### Static typing
bool isNew = 'hello'; // an error
bool isNew = true 

### Dynamic typing
let isNew = true
isNew = 'yup!'
isNew = 1
