One of the most powerful ways of learning code is to learn from 
other peoples good code. 

There are so many framworks and libraries to take inspiration,
and learn from. 

Do this! Don't be afraid by what can seem a bit scary. 

You don't have to do this for hours and hours. Try pick a sinlge
thing at the time that intrigs you about the framwork, look at 
its core, look at its structure. Look at what you can imitate.
