Undefiend is not not value, it is not really undefiende, it is a special 
value that the JS engieen has inside of it and it means that a value
has not been asigned 

undefiend = value as not been asigned 

undifend is a special key word, a special value

NEVER SET YOURSELF A VALUE = undefined
It will make life easier to let undefined only be set by the js engieen

undefined = I never set this value 

Will make life easier when debugging
