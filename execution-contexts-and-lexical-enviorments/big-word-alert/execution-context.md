# Execution context
## A wrapper to help manage the code that is running. 

A lot of lexical enviorments. Which one is currently running is 
managed via execution context. 

Contains the running code but can also contain things beyond
the code you have written. It is executing your code but does,
or can do, a lot of other things.
