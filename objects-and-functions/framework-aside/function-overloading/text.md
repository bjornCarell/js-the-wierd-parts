In other programming languages there is an idea of function overloading,
this means I can have multiple functions with the same name but with
different amount of parameters/arguments

In JS this is not possible since function are objects, and we do not 
really need it either

We dont need to worry about not being able to use function overloading.
Thanks to first class functions we can use other patterns
