We know that when a function is created a new Exectuon Context is created
and with that comes the 
Variable Enviorment, for storing our variables 
'this' keyword, pointing to different objects depending where our functions sits and how it is invoked
Outer Enviorment 

When a function is invoked it also creates the 'arguments' key word 
'arguments' contain a list of all the parameters you pass to a function 

Today we use the spread operator instead of 'arguments'
