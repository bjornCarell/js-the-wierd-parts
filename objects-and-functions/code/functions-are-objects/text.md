Function : a special type of object

We can attach primitves, objects and other functions to a function because
functions are objects 

Functions are objects and has their own properties 

The code you write inside a function is not the function, the function is
the function Object and the code is one of its properties

Function Object Properties : 
primitives,
Object,
Function,
Name (optional, can be anonymous),
Code,

The special thing about the Code property is that it can be invoked, it
is invocable, we invoke it by using () paranthesis

let theFunctionObject = {
    name (optional, can be anonymous),
    invoce,
    code,
    primitive,
    object,
}
