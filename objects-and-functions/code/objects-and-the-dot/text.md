An object can have many different values properties

Primitive   "property"
Object      "property"
Function    "method"

Objects are sitting in memory, with properties, that are also sitting in memory. 

Always use the dot operator 
if not
you need to handle a dynamicly changing string as operator, ex. would
be to use a property as a function argument
